INSTALLATION: Unzip to a folder of your choice, e.g., C:\ComDetTB. Then read C:\ComDetTB\Help\QuickHelp.pdf

ATTENTION: Some algorithms are NOT included in this version (v.0.90) of CDTB, due to limitations imposed by MathWorks on the File Exchange.
A newer version (v.0.91) with the extra algorithms is available at http://users.auth.gr/~kehagiat/Software/ComDetTBv091.zip
